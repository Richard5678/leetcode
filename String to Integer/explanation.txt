This question focuses more on case analysis. 
My approch uses a lot of boolean variables to store certain states of the program.
For example, signedReached and digitReached indicates if we have seen signs or digits so far.
The hard part about this problem was checking overflows. 
I used variables to store INT_MAX / 10 and INT_MIN / 10 respectively. Then check the last digit of the result.
One thing I struggled with was I forgot that we shouldn't store the result of calculation inside a int variable.
When I did that, we will never get an overflow since an int type variable cannot store anything greater than INT_MAX or less than INT_MIN
